Assets folder would be to hold assets, so things like textures and audio, things we put into our game objects to make them work
Game objects would hold the prefabs we use to create levels and stuff
Scenes would hold scene
Script scripts, might be better to include this in game Objects where we name scripts the same as game objects

You get it just tell me if something else works better
